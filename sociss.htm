and Change</u> 23(1): 71-100.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd> An article that discusses the role of the Brasilian military in Amazônian

and mark" frontiers.
</p>
<p>
Bunker, Stephen J.<br>
1984 Modes of extraction, unequal exchange, and the progressive underdevelopment of an extreme periphery: the 
Brasilian Amazon. <u>American Journal of Sociology</u>
89(5): 1017-1064.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>This article focuses on the extraction and export of natural
resources has an effect on developmental potential in the 
Amazon region. The consequences of this frontier underdevelopment are then explained in core-periphery 
terms. 
</p>
<p>
Galloway, J. H.<br>
1982 Human geography in Brazil during the 1970's: debates
and research. <u>Luso-Brazilian Review</u> 19(1): 1-21. <br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>J. H. Galloway discusses the "new geography" and Brasil's 
geographic heritage as it pertains to Amazônia. Aspects of
frontier development such as roadbuilding and the fate of 
indigenous peoples are dealt with in the Amazônia portion of
the paper.
</p>
<p>
Godfrey, Brian <br>
1990 Boom towns of the Amazon. <u>Geographical Rewiew</u>
80(2): 103-118.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>Brian Godfrey sheds light on the hidden truth that Amazônia 
is home to new, dynamic urban centers such as Maraba and 
Xinguara in this article. He frames urban development on the frontier in the context of land disputes over ranching, mining, farming, and timbering.
</p>
<p>
Goza, Franklin <br>
1992 Brazilian frontier settlement: the case of Rondonia. <u>
Population and Environment</u> 16(1): 37-61.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>An article resting on the assumption that Amazônia's frontier is
culturally unique and exemplifies this by studying the situation
in Rondônia, Brasil. Goza also asserts that the availability of 
cheap land determines the "opening" and "closing" of the 
Rondônia frontier in its history.
</p>
<p>
Haller, Archibald O.<br>
1982 Socioeconomic regionalization of Brazil. <u> Geographic
Review</u>  72(4): 450-464.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>Haller attempts to distinguish regions of Brazil on the basis of
economics and demographics. This project also seeks to 
establish 360 microregions determined by homogeneity in each
area's ecology. Haller's regional divisions may be more effective at marking boundaries on the frontier than the current 
political boundaries are.  
</p>
<p>
Kyle, Steven C. and Aercio C. Cunha<br>
1992 National factor markets and the macroeconomic context 
for environmental destruction in the Brazilian Amazon. <u> 
Development and Change</u> 23(1): 7-34.<br>
</p>
<p>
<dd>This is an article that criticizes current development policy for 
treating the Amazon as being devoid of people or long-term 
economic potential. The authors see this region as an "open" 
frontier, and seek a model of for sustainable development in
Amazônia. Also of note here is their emphasis on studying 
economic links of both the frontier itself and to the larger 
Brasilian market. 
</p>
<p>
Pollak, Harrison, Marli Mattos, and Christopher Uhl<br>
1995 Profile of palm-heart extraction in the Amazon estatuary.
<u>Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal</u> 23(3):
357-386.
</p>
<p>
<dd>These authors advocate the harvest of palm-hearts as a renewable 
resource by frontier farmers. Pollak, Mattos, and Uhl argue that this crop
is both sustainable and cost-effective for farms located on this ecologically
sensitive frontier. The article also discusses how expansion of palm-hearts
can aid in forest management.
</p>
<p>
Weinstein, Barbara<br>
1985  New views on Amazonian development. <u>Luso-Brazilian
Review</u> 22(1): 79-88.
</p>
<p>
<dd>A book review that critiques both Nigel Smith's <u>Rainforest Corridors</u>
and Emilio Moran's <u>The Dilemma of Amazonian Development </u> while 
also asking questions about these books in this light.

ethnographic analogy, this experimental program seeks to put this type of Pre-
Columbian agriculture back into practice.
