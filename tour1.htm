</p><dd> This presentation is a generalized demonstration of the stages involved
in an average archaeological investigation. For our purposes, we 
will be investigating a ficticious desertic environment. The 
image to the left is a tent that will serve as the base of 
operations for the present archaeological season.<br>
</dd><dd> Throughout this 
tour, we will be observing the processes involved in excavating 
this desert site at a general level. However, the specific examples 
of technique and procedure will come from other sites and contexts.

</p></dd><dd> For this season, our research team will be exploring an area of
the desert floor near several spring-fed rivers. The main objectives 
for this year are to find material remains representing a span of
several thousand years, map and reconstruct the prehistoric 
environment, and discover what species of plant and animal were
once indigenous to the area.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</dd><dd> The first step in the process of answering these questions 
comes with the reconnaisance and survey of the area to be explored.
This is what is called a data universe, and includes all possible 
areas of exploration within the immediate region. In common parlance,
the name of the immediate region would be the site. Now let's attempt to
find promising areas for potential finds.
