</p></dd><dd>At this site is a map that shows an area on the western edge of
Amazônia that has been claimed by both Ecuador and Peru for 
many years. Several armed conflicts have been waged over this
strip of land, and thus is proof that nation-state penetration of 
Amazônia has had major consequences.

</p></dd><dd>This is a site that contains maps of Amazônian climatological 
patterns between 18,000  years ago and the present. These maps 
demonstrate both how the Amazon region is capable of changing
over time and what type of environment  ancient populations might have faced.
