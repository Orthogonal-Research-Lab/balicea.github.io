<h1>1. Books </h1>
<p>
Chagnon, Napoleon<br>
1974 <u>Studying the Yanomamo.</u> Holt, Rhinehart, and 
Winston, New York.
</p>
<dd>This book provides ethnographic data such as geneologies, pictures, settlement patterns, and village relations. The Yanomamo 
live on the border of Venezuela and Brasil in numerous villages, one 
of which Chagnon took a complete census of for a section in his 
book. There are also sections with personal interviews, a chapter on ethnographic film, and a glossary of Sociocultural terminology.

<p>
Hemming, John<br>
1981 <u>Colonial Frontier: Plight of the Brazilian Indians.</u>
Anti-Slavery Society, London.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> A book that deals with the history of contact among six 
indigenous groups. Hemming also frames the larger history 
of expansion in Brasil to the need for cheap land, which is 
in turn leading to the destruction of indigenous groups.
<p></p>
<p>
Kane, Joe<br>
1995 <u>Savages.</u> Knopf, New York.
</p>

development. 
<p></p>

</u> E. P. Dutton, New York.

</p></dd><dd>Jeffery O'Connor is a film documentarian writing about the gold rush in Amazonia and the relations between settlers and indigenous people. His book concentrates on the situation in Brasil, while also offering many images of the subject matter. O'Connor approaches 
the subject by talking about resources versus people and their cultural
environment.
<p></p>
<p>
Sponsel, Leslie E. ed. <br>
1995 <u>Indigenous Peoples and the Future of Amaz么nia: An Ecological Anthropology of an Endangered World. </u> University

own insights, Archaeological and Physical Anthropological 
perspectives are included to lend support for historical discussions 
on ecology and sustainability in the Amazon.

<h1>2. Articles</h1>
<p>
Albert, Bruce <br>
1992  Indian Lands, environmental policy, and military geopolitics, in the development of the Brazilian Amazon: the
case of the <i>Yanomami</i>. <u>Development and Change</u>
23(1): 35-70.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>This paper illustrates how the military dictatorship's "indigenous policy" affected <i>Yanomami</i> culture and the 
expropriation of their lands. Albert also evaluates how this
type of frontier policy changed if at all during the New Republic
from 1985 to 1990.
<p></p>
<p>
Frechione, John<br>
1990 Supervillage formation in the Amazon terra firme: the case
of Asensona. <u>Ethnology</u> 29(2): 117-134.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>This article talks about the <i>Yekuana </i> village of Asensona that
developed during the 1960's to take advantage of emerging 
frontier market links. This village was unusually large for Amaz么nia, but Frechione says that economic conditions and
not the environment are responsible for settlement scale in this region.
<p></p>
<p>
Stearman, Allyn MacLean<br>
1990 Effects of settler incursion on fish and game resources of the 
<i>Yuqui</i>. <u>Human Organization</u> 49(4): 373-385.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>Stearman's paper targets settlement and deforestation on 
the
frontier as contributing to the destruction of indigenous people.
The focus of this study is the <i>Yuqui</i>, who have been confined to
missions and can no longer practice their nomadic lifeways 
because of settler incursions into their territory.
