### 2009-2014 PhD and Postdoctoral work in Cell/Molecular and Quantitative Biology. Michigan State University.
<br> 
**Thesis title: [Reprogramming to the nervous system: a computational and candidate gene approach](https://osf.io/v7dnk/).**

Research on the phenotypic reprogramming of animal cells (e.g. generation of iPSCs, iNCs, and iSMCs) using computational, bioengineering, and molecular techniques. This includes the fundamental properties, cellular mechanisms, and applications of cellular plasticity and artificially-induced neuronal cells (neurons and muscle).

### 2011-2013  Technology commercialization analyst, MSU Technologies, East Lansing, MI.

Assessment of technological innovations in terms of marketability and start-up potential. Areas of expertise: computational biology, nanotechnology, robotics.

### 2003-2009 PhD specialization in Cognitive Science (Computing and Cognitive Neuroscience). Media Interface and Network Design (MIND) Lab, Michigan State University. 
<br>
**Research topic: Augmented Cognition, Neuromechanics, and Adaptive Variation in Virtual Environments.**

Virtual environments, human neuromechanics, and computational models to understand human behavior. Application domains include the integration of mechanical devices, interactive computing, haptic interfaces, and physiological function. Application of kinematic, behavioral, and electrophysiological measurements to a host of problems at the intersection of virtual environments and human performance.

### 1999-2002  Masters in Anthropology and Zoology. Mulligan Human Genetics Lab, Department of Anthropology, University of Florida. 
**Thesis title: [Evaluating Intraspecific Variation and Interspecific Diversity: comparing humans, non-human Primates, and fish species](https://osf.io/sme2y/).**

A phylogenetic approach to intraspecific (within-species) and interspecific (between-species) mitochondrial DNA and morphological variation. Comparative data from non-human Primates and other vertebrates are also utilized. Comparative taxonomic, demographic, and molecular variance research on human and non-human molecular markers.

### 1997	Bachelors in Anthropology. Michigan State University.
