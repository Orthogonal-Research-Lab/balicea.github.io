MMG  302:  Laboratory  Instructor,  General  Microbiology  Laboratory,  Department  of  Microbiology  and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, Spring and Summer 2012.

The teaching task was to supervise students during a laboratory practicum. Students wrote up reports on their exercises and received feedback from the instructor. The course had 16-24 students per section, and the degree of student-instructor interaction was high. 


QB  828:  Module  on  Evolutionary  Systems  Biology,  Biology  for  the  Interdisciplinary  Scientist, Quantitative Biology Program, Michigan State University, Spring 2009 and Spring 2010. 

The teaching task was to introduce and engage quantitative-oriented students (e.g. physicists, engineers) to evolutionary biology. The course was developed as a module of an existing course on Quantitative Biology methods. The module consists of a series of lectures, homework assignments, and exam questions. The course had 10-14 students per year, and the degree of student-instructor interaction was high.

The teaching task was to assist in the instruction of an honors college course (50-60 students) on cross-cultural perspectives for understanding the rise and fall of “low-visibility” civilizations.  Topical focus ranged from paleoanthropology to historical archaeology. Workload involved the grading of written exams along with the development of lectures and exam questions. The degree of student-instructor interaction was moderately high.


ANG 2301: Human Sexuality, Department of Anthropology, University of Florida, Fall 1999 and 2000.

The teaching task was to facilitate discussion and instruction, grade term papers, and develop exam questions for a class of 700 students. Discussion and term paper writing took place in sections of 25-30 students each. In the discussion groups, the degree of student-instructor interaction was moderately high.
