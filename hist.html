</p>
<p>
</p><dd>A book that tells the story of English and Irish attempts at
settling along the Amazon during the 17th century. In Lorimer's

outposts to be part of this expansion, run by companies that 
gained concessions from the Spanish and Portuguese crowns.

Review</u> 19(2): 169-185.

<p>
Hemming, John<br>
1990 How Brazil aquired Roraima. <u>Luso-Brazilian Review
</u> 70(2): 295-325.
</p>
</dd><dd>Hemming covers the early history of Roraima and how Spaniards, Dutch, and English were all involved in early

define regional frontiers.
<p></p>
<p>
Katzman, Martin T.<br>
1978 Colonization as an approach to regional development.
<u>Economic Development and Cultural Change</u> 26(4):
709-724.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>A study which uses the example of Northern Parana, which is 
not in Amazônia but is compared to Amazônian colonization
and is evaluated in this light by Katzman. This development 
scheme in particular was built by British capital, and is the most
successful colonization program on any South American frontier
to date.
<p></p>
<p>
Kelly, Brian J. and Mark London<br>
1983 The new frontier. <u>Wilson Quarterly</u> 12(3): 62-76.
</p>

</p></dd><dd>An article that focuses on the history and actors behind Amazônian development in Brasil. Government officials, the

desire to create a great nation.
<p></p>
<p>
Maligo, Pedro<br>
1991 Symbolic Territory: representation of Amazônia in Brasilian
literature. <u>Centennial Review</u> 35(2): 229-248.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>Pedro Maligo takes into consideration the romanticism contained in much of Amazônian literature. Images fostered
by these works have led to gross misrepresentations of the 
region by outsiders. Maligo also shows Amazônia's frontier
as central to ideological debates within Brasil.
