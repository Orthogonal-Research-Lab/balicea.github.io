<h3> Here is an exploration and summation of various archaeological projects ongoing in Amazonia, exploring 
both the contemporary frontier and prehistoric lifeways. 
</h3>
<h1>1. Books </h1>
<p>
Roosevelt, Anna Curtenius<br>
1980  <u> Parmaná: Prehistoric Maize and Manioc Subsistence Along the Amazon and Orinoco. </u> Academic Press, New York.
</p>
<p>
</p><dd>Roosevelt chronicles her own research to challenge the conventional view that Amazônia has traditionally been exclusively home to forest subsistence strategies. She introduces theories
by Meggers, Carneiro, and others, and then tells how the data from
Parmaná better supports an alternative view of prehistoric 
subsistence. 
<p></p>
<p>
Willey, Gordon R.<br>
1971 <u> An Introduction to American Archaeology Volume Two:
South America. </u> Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>Gordon Willey offers information about the culture history of
Amazônia in Chapter 6. He discusses all aspects of the prehistoric
and contemporary indigenous people of the region, and also offers
the reader maps, pictures, and a chronological chart of stylistic
phases of pottery design.

<h1> 2. Articles </h1>
<p>
Meggers, Betty<br>
1951 Pre-Columbian Colonization of the Amazon. <u> Archaeology </u> 4:110-114. <br>
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>In this article, Meggers investigates several earthen mounds on Marajó Island at the mouth of the Amazon. She uses pottery styles 
to examine the apex and eventual demise of the <i>Marajoara</i> culture. Meggers also speculates about the social structure and 
cultural history of these people.

Roosevelt, A.C., M. Lima da Costa, C. Lopes Machado, M. Michab
H. Vallados, N. Toth, J. Feathers, M. Imazio da Silveira, B. Chernoff,
N. Mercier, J.A. Holman, K. Schick, D.S. Reese, W. Barnett<br>
1996 Paleoindian Cave Dwellers in the Amazon: The Peopling of the
Americas. <u> Science </u> 19 April: 373-384.
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>This 1996 article is significant because it presents the notion of
habitation at Monte Alegre in Brasil during the late Pleistocene. 
Previously unthinkable, the notion of non-Clovis cultures in the
Americas during this time period is advocated by Roosevelt and 
others.
<p></p>
<p>
Wilbert, Johannes<br>
1977 Navigators of the Winter Sun. In <u>The Sea in the Pre-Columbian World. </u> Elizabeth P. Benson ed. Dunbarton Oaks,
Washington D.C. 
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>Wilbert discusses the cultural history of the canoe in Warao
society. Even though the Warao reside in the Orinoco region, this article is relevant to experimental archaeology projects in Amazônia 
dedicated to building a typical river canoe. <u> Navigators</u>
also contains sources on how canoes are important to indigenous
cosmology and mythology. The author also demonstrates the 
stages involved in building a canoe and the technologies used.

(http://artalpha.anu.edu.au/web/arc/resources/papers/ausdates/
ausdates.htm") 
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> An Australian site that calculates how much Carbon 14 is left in 
an artifact or faunal remain after so many years, this link is also relevant to dating remains from research being done in Amazonia.  
<p></p>
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010209000917/http://dizzy.library.edu/users/mount/treering.html" target="_parent"> 
Dendrochronology/ Tree-Ring Resources. </a> (http://dizzy.library.
edu/users/mount/treering.html)
</p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> This is a site sponsored by the University of Arizona library that
offers links to information on dendrochronology, GIS, and
hydrology. Dendrochronology is a dating method performed by measuring
and counting the rings of living and dead trees and then determining 
the age of associated artifacts. Such a method is only good for 
dating finds younger than 5000 years old.

the Dendrochronology Lab at the University of Sheffield. The site
also contains a summation of the lab's current research projects.
