Environments</font></h1><br>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><dd> The cultural ecology of marginal environments has been studied using 
several generalized methodologies. Researchers have used approaches 
such as structuralism, reductionism, and ecological anthropology in order
to find the relationship between behavior and scarcity. For the purposes 
of this article, the terms structuralism and reductionism have special
definitions. Reductionists generally believe that ecology is the primary 
force shaping cultures, while structuralists take a plurality of forces into 
account when explaining cultural change. Structuralists feel that ecology
is the anchor for an evolving society within which exist many dynamic 
social institutions. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Among these frameworks, questions exist about perceptions held by 
both research subjects and the anthropologist. This would include issues
of how cultural preferences are constructed and the way individual 
anthropologists account for this in terms of theory. Yet it is also worth
keeping in mind that anthropologists have their own preferences when
the time comes to analyze and interpret empirical data. Measuring the
power of perception is an important part of methodology in this area of
cultural ecology, because the way people see the world around them 
ultimately determines their place in it.   
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Allen Johnson explores the running debate between structuralists and
reductionists in Amazonian studies, while also applying an emic view to
Machiguenga society. In "Reductionism in Cultural Ecology" (1982), he 
views the works of people like Napoleon Chagnon as structuralist. Johnson
portrays structuralism as ultimately being superceded by a reductionist 
framework for explaining social organization. This research also advocates 
a theoretical framework that utilizes ecological factors as the most
important in a series of causes influencing social development (Johnson
1982, 415). Even though he takes a pluralistic instead of a purely 
reductionist approach, Johnson disagrees with Chagnon in the application
of data to social structures. Generally speaking, structuralists feel that the
environment has played an indirect role at best in shaping Amazonian
society (Johnson 1982, 413). 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Napoleon Chagnon is an example of a researcher employing 
structuralism to understand the Yanomami people. His work is derived
from a structural analysis, and suggests that social complexity arose 
along the lines of a value system that was reinforced through warfare
(Johnson 1982, 413; Moran 1991, 361). Thus, structural research in 
Amazonia looks down upon a mainly ecological explanation for human
behavior. To illustrate this, Chagnon uses a holistic approach to examine 
both the biostructure and the social structure within which the Yanomamo
exist. Generally speaking, structuralists believe societies are too complex for environmental
factors to be exclusive in shaping the nature of culture (Johnson 1982,
416). This statement also exposes a flaw in reductionism, for
presumably only structuralists can focus on both plural causation 
and the importance of ecological factors. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Yet as structuralist researchers often criticize a purely ecological
explanation, they use a similar approach as part of a strategy to explain 
structural variations among societies. In addition, Napoleon Chagnon's 
work as presented by Allen Johnson is criticized by the latter researcher
on two fronts. In one instance, Chagnon claims that the structural manifestation 
of scarcity is a highly developed military aparatus. This seems to be a 
valid point, but Johnson claims that Chagnon has tended to focus on
warfare in his studies. Johnson goes on to say that Chagnon's own 
perception of Yanomami value systems may have produced such an 
interpretation. However, it must be pointed out that Napoleon Chagnon has
conducted extensive and intimate studies on facets of Yanomami culture 
such as kinship structure and population dynamics. Therefore, it is unfair 
to say that a focus on warfare is derived mainly from personal bias. In a
more general criticism, the structuralist use of holism as an analytical 
tool may be flawed because there are simply too many "wholes" in any 
given context (Johnson 1982, 416).
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> As revisionism affects every field of study each generation, it has 
touched this branch of cultural ecology as well. More recent studies
have been reductionist in scope, concentrating exclusively on ecology 
in order to explain sociocultural responses to scarcity. Carole Stein-(1993)
sees the need for ecological information by individual foraging groups
as creating economic, demographic, and other social structures within
these societies (Stein-Mandryk 1993:47). She points to how bands of
25 are an optimum size for subsistence in a marginal environment, 
but that groups of 400 are neccessary for reproductive survival 
(Stein-Mandryk 1993:45). A similar observation is made by Colin 
Turnbull among the Pygmys of Central Africa. Within Pygmy society,
each married man owns a hunting net. In order for each band to 
have a successful hunt, they need anywhere from eight to thirty nets 
per party. As a consequence of this environmental constriction, there 
are also eight to thirty nuclear families in a band (Turnbull 1967, as 
cited in McGuire 1992: 105). Thus both Stein-Mandryk and Turnbull
concentrate on ecological factors which limit and shape social 
relations in their analysis.
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Anna Roosevelt concentrates on the issue of subsistence as she 
presents a unique reductionist-based theory framed within an 
archaeological context. Roosevelt addresses the issue of prehistoric
seasonal scarcity in her analysis, and asks what the carrying capacity
of tropical rainforests would be if year-long shortages were not an 
issue. On one hand, resources needed to be conserved in order to 
meet the demands of the dry season. Yet because of flooding and the
subsequent decline in fishing yields during the rainy season, populations
also faced an annual protien crisis. (Roosevelt 1980:105). While Roosevelt's
theory is more abstract, it still conforms to the reductionism of Stein-
Mandryk and Turnbull. In addition, such a theory appears to be more
feasible for Archaeological investigations because reconstructing the 
structure and lifeways of past cultures is not always possible.
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> While the reductionist methodology seems to be a complete methodology, 
there have been criticisms leveled at its exclusivity. While Stein-Mandryk 
argues that social cohesion can only be maintained by restricting specific
cultures within a set of environmental limits, she also points out that other 
forces are at work shaping society (Stein-Mandryk 1993:67). Researchers
must demonstrate mechanisms that link empirical data with a pre-determined 
process (Stein-Mandryk 1993:39). Gerardo Bamonte also says that
researchers must find a balance between structuralism and reductionism
in order to give a more complete representation of people (Bamonte 1983:
24). 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> If that balance cannot be found and reductionism succeeds in 
eliminating other points of view, then research 
on the whole will suffer. Allen Johnson forsees dishonest analysis and boring 
debate if a synthesis between structuralism and reductionism does not occur
(Bamonte 1982:418). Yet even if this type of pluralistic approach does help
researchers see their subjects in a balanced way, there may still be a
problem. According to Johnson, if ethnologists become too objective they tend
to lose their humanity (1982:417). Such a dilemma could then be solved by 
invoking a second dimension of theory which is grounded in the emic-etic
debate.
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Pierre Grenand and Allen Johnson both support paying attention to the 
indigenous point of view (Bamonte 1982:116). Johnson bases his study of
Machiguenga society on indigenous perceptions of scarcity and acceptable 
resources (Johnson 1982:415). According to this interpretation, social 
organization is based on cultural preferences which are indirectly linked 
to environmental factors. However, an emic perspective not only 
emphasizes the indigenous dimension, but also identifies Western cultural
bias in analysis. For example, the idea that nature and culture are seperate 
entities is an explicitly Western cultural bias that structuralists tend to 
embrace (Bamonte 1983:116). On the other hand, the ecosystem concept 
embraced by Johnson which tends to destroy the division between nature 
and culture also tends to distort the role of very real socially constructed 
institutions. Even though most of my examples take a view in between the 
two extremes of structuralism and reductionism, they are nevertheless 
good examples of conceptual bases from which these theories derive their
inspiration. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Emilio Moran moves away from the structuralist-reductionist debate to an
extent in "Human adaptive strategies in Amazonian blackwater ecosystems"
(1991) by concentrating on a pluralistic approach. Moran is concerned about 
how people have adapted to their environments and how this have affected 
the social structure. He also sets up a continuum in which people attempt to
lessen the affects of scarcity upon society by selecting from a number of 
survival strategies. Presumably, the number of these strategies diminish only
when people live in extremely impoverished environments (Moran 1991:
361). 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Moran is careful in applying this framework to blackwater regions 
only (1991:362), and contrasts his findings there with results from other parts 
of Amazonia. Much like Stein-Mandryk, Moran focuses on the flexible 
distribution of resources within a region (Moran 1991;375). If this is not 
possible in that a society is too far to one side or the other on Moran's
continuum, then political hierarchy will result and lead to the Chagnon 
military society model. Moran goes further in terms of an emic analysis, 
claiming that indigenous people are aware of and usually in accord with their 
environmental surroundings (Moran 1991:375). In critiquing Chagnon's research
and structuralism as an explanatory framework though, Moran treats a
hierarchical context as an anomaly within Amazonian studies. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> It is also important to view paradigm shifts in methodology according to the
historical period in which various research approaches are rooted. Warfare 
studies were used in the 1950's and 60's to explain social structure, and were 
an outgrowth of cold war concerns during the period (Patterson 1987:23) Leslie
White and his "Michigan evolutionist" disciples created a superstructure in
which the mediating force for change was a phenomenon of an ecological 
nature (Patterson 1987:24). This relates to how contemporary Western 
bueraucracies deal with things such as natural disasters. Thomas C. Paterson
(1987) brings up White in his article that links all study of cultural ecology 
in this century with political and economic concerns relevant to the observer's 
society. For example, the post-World War II era interest in ecologists by 
Anthropologists was derived primarily from concerns about economic growth 
and global developmentalism (Patterson 1987:15). This is probably true of 
Amazonia, where the concerns of independent researchers led to 
different methodologies. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Yet despite the exploration of divergent interest areas, Western researchers 
have tended to take either a structuralist of reductionist view of indigenous 
societies. This reflects concerns about both adhereing to a "scientific" 
methodology in Anthropology and Western standards of the importance 
of structures in a bureaucratic society. Undoubtely, this stems from an 
etic perspective which can be moderated by balancing structuralism and
reductionism along with incorporating contextual emic case studies. The 
work of Allen Johnson that discovered Machiguenga perceived scarcity
through things like land and firewood typologies is a case in point (Johnson
1982:414). Another idea postulated by Patterson has to do with recent
redefinitions of studying culture and the environment. 
<p></p>
<p>
</p></dd><dd> Ecological anthropology, which is best exemplified through the work of 
Emilio Moran, uses contextual studies in terms of both culture and 
environment. It should be noted at this point that research done since the 
1970's have been influenced by the global environmental movement. The
basic relationship between people and nature in the Western mind has been 
changed by environmentalism. Earlier in the 20th century, it was assumed
that only the "simplest" of peoples were intertwined with their natural 
environment, while Western analysis which seperated the natural world 
from the cultural was the only way to properly analyze society. Yet probably
most importantly, ecological anthropology has allowed researchers to 
expand their methodological horizons. Much like the current scenario with
ecological anthropology, studying human ecology allowed European 
anthropologists of the mid-20th century to go beyond the standard Marxist
and structuralist analyses (Bamonte 1983:116).
<p>
</p>
</dd><dd> In several case studies and examples of methodological variance, the
cultural ecology of marginal environments seems to involve many 
approaches. Yet I believe that above all else that researchers must
contextualize the relationship between social structures and ecological
change while utilizing an emic viewpoint as a balancing force instead of
simply imposing typologies on people and data. Only then will a truly
representative model of human adaptations and lifeways emerge. As
for the debate between structural analysis and reductionist science, I
believe that they should be synthesized but framed within a specific
historical context. Only by carefully examining people and their 
surroundings in this way can research lead us to a better understanding
of the people behind natural and social processes.
